                                        <p>The vision of F3 is that higher education has the potential to support economic mobility and pathways to prosperity in the San Joaquin Valley, a region of challenges and opportunities. As the Valley Institute for Sustainability, Technology & Agriculture (VISTA) and Food, Farms, Future (F3) Executive Director at the University of California, Merced, Dr. Bernacchi brings together industry and academia partners to solve wicked problems in climate change and food-energy-water systems. As UC Merced has doubled in student body and footprint in the past five years, Dr. Bernacchi has supported faculty in accessing $100M in ag-tech grants. She ensures broader impacts and participation for community members through strategic and intentional outreach programming. UC Merced is also launching a new Experimental Smart Farm for which Dr. Bernacchi developed faculty visioning documents and campus support. Dr. Bernacchi holds a PhD from Texas A&M University and conducted post-doctoral research at the University of Idaho with a focus in technology adoption, climate change adaptation, and agriculture.</p>
